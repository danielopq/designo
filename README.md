## Overview

This project is a fully responsive website for a fictional international creative agency, designed and developed using React and structured into well-organized, reusable components. It is built with TypeScript to ensure strong typing across the application, improving reliability and maintainability.

All styles are written in SASS, allowing for modular and scalable styling throughout the site. Office locations are loaded dynamically from a JSON data source, which simplifies the process of adding, editing, or removing locations without modifying the core logic. Each location is also visually represented on an interactive map using Leaflet, enhancing the user experience.

The website includes a fully validated contact form with client-side validation logic to ensure all inputs are accurate and properly formatted before submission. It has been developed following responsive design principles, delivering an optimized experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## My process

The development of this project followed a mobile-first approach, ensuring a solid user experience on small devices before progressively adapting the design to larger screens such as tablets and desktops.

Each section of the website was built as an isolated and reusable component, focusing on modularity and clarity. The structure allowed for easy iteration, testing, and styling of each individual block before assembling them into full pages.

- Component-by-Component Development: Components such as the navigation bar, form fields, buttons, and layout blocks were developed individually, using SCSS modules for scoped styling.

- Mobile-First Styling: Layout and design were first crafted for mobile devices using media queries, which allowed for clear scalability as the screen size increased.

- Progressive Enhancement: Once each component functioned well on mobile, enhancements were introduced for tablets and desktopsâ€”adjusting grid layouts, font sizes, and spacing to suit larger viewports.

- Data Integration: Office locations were injected dynamically from a JSON file to keep logic and data decoupled, enabling easier updates and maintenance.

- Validation and Interactivity: Custom React hooks were used to manage form validation and interactivity, ensuring all inputs were user-friendly and accessible.
